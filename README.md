Share a Song

The world is not a prefect place. But we try to make it better and this ShareSong app is exactly for this.
Have you ever had a situation, when you have found THE BEST SONG EVER and want to share it with your friends, family, beloved ones or with a whole world but there is a problem? How can you do it, if you listen to music, for example on Spotify and your friends on AppleMusic? What happens then? Nothing. You have to start looking manually for the link to the song on google and this makes us tired. We lose that desire to share because it becomes complicated. And that is why a lot of great songs were left alone. Letâ€™s fix this!

We offer you a ShareSong app, that simplifies sharing.
How does it work? Easy ;)

1. Copy link to the song from Spotify or AppleMusic
2. Open ShareSong app
3. Magic Happens
4. Done

Now you have both links from AppleMusic and Spotify for a song that you want to share.
Congratulations, the world becomes a bit better.

Never stop share music <3
